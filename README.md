# Day-Planner

# Description
We were asked to create a coding quiz website that includes a home page, a five question quiz, local storage of score and user, and a highscore page. The timer shows in the top right when taking the quiz, 10 seconds is taken off time for every wrong answer. Multiple users will be stored in the highscore page along with the option to clear highscores.
## Issues
The primary issue for this project was trying to get the javascript to work with multiple html pages. Another challenge was getting the score and user to store as a local storage element.
